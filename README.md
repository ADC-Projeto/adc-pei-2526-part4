# APDC-PEI 25/26 — First Web Application (Part 4)

Building on Part 3, this version introduces **Google Cloud Tasks** to offload long-running computations asynchronously, and adds a **protected secret page** accessible only via the web interface.

---

## What changed from Part 3

- A new **`GET /rest/utils/compute`** endpoint was added that triggers an async task via **Google Cloud Tasks** instead of blocking the request thread
- A **`webapp/secret/index.html`** page was added, intended to be accessible only to authenticated users

---

## What this app does

The app serves a simple web page with the following available services:

- **`POST /rest/login/`** —  authenticates a user and returns a JSON auth token
- **`GET /rest/login/{username}`** — checks whether a username is already taken
- **`GET /rest/utils/hello`** — intentionally throws an exception and redirects to `/error/500.html`
- **`GET /rest/utils/time`** — returns the current server time in JSON
- **`GET /rest/utils/compute`** — enqueues an async computation task via Cloud Tasks

---

## Cloud Tasks

The `/rest/utils/compute` endpoint demonstrates how to offload a long-running task (e.g. a 10-minute computation) without blocking the HTTP request. Instead of running it inline, it enqueues a task to **Google Cloud Tasks**, which then triggers a `POST /rest/utils/compute` on the App Engine backend asynchronously.

> ⚠️ Cloud Tasks only works when deployed to Google App Engine. It will not work when running locally with `mvn appengine:run`.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html)
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) (for cloud deployment)
- [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) with the Maven plugin

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and clone the repository

Fork the project on GitHub, then clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:APDC-Projeto/apdc-pei-2526-part4.git
cd apdc-pei-2526-part4
```

### 2. Import into Eclipse

1. Open Eclipse and go to **File → Import → Maven → Existing Maven Projects**
2. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the project
3. Select it and click **Finish**
4. Eclipse will resolve dependencies automatically — check for any errors in the **Problems** tab

---

## Building the project

From the project root, run:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

If the build succeeds, you'll find the compiled `.war` file at:

```
target/Firstwebapp-0.0.1.war
```

---

## Running locally

Start the local App Engine dev server with:

```bash
mvn appengine:run
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

---

## Deploying to Google App Engine

### 1. Create a project on Google Cloud Console

Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ and create a new project. Take note of the Project ID.

### 2. Enable Cloud Tasks

In the Google Cloud Console, enable the **Cloud Tasks API** for your project and make sure a queue named `Default` exists in your chosen region.

### 3. Update `ComputationResource.java`

Replace the placeholder project ID before deploying:

```java
String projectId = "your-project-id"; // ← replace with your GCP project ID
```

### 4. Authenticate with Google Cloud

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project <your-proj-id>
```

### 5. Deploy

```bash
mvn appengine:deploy -Dapp.deploy.projectId=<your-proj-id> -Dapp.deploy.version=<version-number>
```

After a successful deploy, your app will be live at:

```
https://<your-project-id>.appspot.com/
```

### Testing with Postman

1. Open [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and create a new request
2. Set the method to GET and the URL to `https://<your-project-id>.appspot.com/rest/utils/compute`
3. Click Send

Returns `200 OK` immediately, while the actual computation is processed asynchronously in the background by Cloud Tasks.
